Build with:

perl Makefile.PL
make test
make install

Note that quadmath.h and -lquadmath need to be found, and do exist in recent versions of
the GNU C compiler (gcc).
However, perl may not be aware of the location of libquadmath,  so you may need to help
it along by starting with:

perl Makefile.PL LIBS="-L/location/of/quadmath_library -lquadmath"
